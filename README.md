## Background

The purpose of this project was to create a book-tracking app using the React framework. I was given a large amount of HTML and CSS code so that I could focus my time primarily on the React components.

React was one of the first frameworks that I learned about from Udacity, and this project was an opportunity to experiment with the foundational skills that I learned.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. `cd` into the root directory

3. Install all dependencies: `npm install`

4. Start local server: `npm start`

## How-To-Use

* There are 3 shelves to store your books:

  * Read

  * Currently Reading

  * Want To Read

* Press the 'plus' button on the bottom right to search for books that you would like to add to your shelves

* Click on any book that you have searched, and choose which shelf you would like to add that book to

* If you would like to change a book's shelf or remove a book, click on a book in your shelves

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, I will most likely will not accept pull requests.
